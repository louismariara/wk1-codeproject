## Description
This project contains three code challenges. The challenges include:

Calculating a student's grade based on their marks, where the grade is determined by the marks scored. The grade ranges from A to E, with A being the highest grade.
Calculating a driver's speed and determining whether their license should be suspended based on the speed. The speed limit is set at 70, and for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, a point is added. If the total points exceed 12, the license is suspended.
Calculating an employee's net salary based on their basic salary, benefits, PAYE, NSSF deductions, and NHIF deductions. The PAYE is calculated based on the total salary, with different tax brackets applying to different salary ranges.
